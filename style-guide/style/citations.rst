Occasionally you might want to include content from a third-party
source. If you do so, you must ensure that the source is reputable, the
information is accurate, the quoted material is distinguished from the
surrounding content, and the source is cited. Follow these guidelines:

-  Include content only from expert sources that have a named author or
   are from a known company. Don't quote Wikipedia articles.
-  If necessary, verify that the content is accurate.
-  Set off the quoted content from the other content in the following
   ways:

   -  If the quotation is short (just a phrase or sentence), you can
      include it in an existing paragraph. Set the quotation off with
      quotation marks, and put ending punctuation within the closing
      quotation mark.
   -  If the quotation is longer than a phrase or sentence, or it makes
      sense to separate it from the surrounding content, you can place it
      in its own paragraph. Set the quotation off with
      quotation marks, and put ending punctuation within the closing
      quotation mark.
   -  If the quotation extends to multiple paragraphs, set each paragraph
      off with the beginning quotation marks, but include the ending quotation
      marks only at the end of the last paragraph included in the quotation.

      This is the equivalent of a block quotation, but the deconst publishing
      tool does not honor the > character followed by a space that is required
      in markdown and reStructuredText to format a block quotation.
   -  Don't use italics or bold to distinguish quoted content. Use such
      formatting only if it was used in the source.

-  Attribute the source as follows:

   -  If you have just one or two quotations, you can attribute them within
      the article text by stating the author, the source document, or both
      and providing a link to the source. Usually such an attribution would
      precede the quotation, as an introduction to it.
   -  If you have more than one or two quotations, follow each quotation
      with a number in square brackets. Start at [1] and number each
      quotation in the document consecutively. At the end of the document,
      use a numbered list to list each resource in the order that it's
      shown in the article. Cite the author, the name of the source, and
      provide a link to the source. Put the list under a heading such as
      “Numbered citations in this article.” Then, go back to each numbered
      reference in the article and create a link between the reference
      number (such as [1]) and the numbered item at the end of the article.

The following example is a multiple-paragraph quotation, provided because this
might not be something writers are very familiar with:

Oracle describes ADF in Oracle Fusion Middleware Understanding Oracle
Application Development Framework in the following way:

“Oracle Application Development Framework (Oracle ADF) is an end-to-end
application framework that builds on Java EE standards and open-source
technologies to simplify and accelerate implementing enterprise applications.
Oracle ADF is suitable for enterprise developers who want to create
applications that search, display, create, modify, and validate data using
web, mobile, and desktop interfaces.

“You can use the whole Oracle ADF framework to create an application, or you
can use parts of the framework in combination with the other technologies.
Throughout this guide, applications that contain any ADF technologies are
generally referred to as ADF applications. Web applications that incorporate
ADF technologies throughout the business service, model, controller, and view
layers are referred to as Fusion web applications.”

Oracle describes SPWA in FAQ For 12.2.5 - SPWA - Supply Planning Work Area in
the following way:

“The Supply Planning Work Area (SPWA) is a component of the Oracle Advanced
Supply Chain Planning (ASCP).

“12.2.5 VCP introduces a new form for users that is an alternative to the
planner workbench. The standard Planner Workbench is still available and will
not be removed from the applications.

“This form uses the same ADF (Application Development Framework) tech stack
that powers Rapid Planning and Fusion applications—part of the Fusion Middle
Ware (FMW) tech stack. This does not use standard Oracle Forms tech stack that
has been the standard for the last 15+ years.

“It depends on your WebLogic tech stack and ADF rendering of the forms.”
