User interface guidelines
=========================

Helix is a Rackspace-chartered effort to unify the look, feel, and
functionality of Rackspace interfaces. Helix is one system, composed of
a `design library for designers <http://helix.rax.io/getting-started/design.html>`__, which includes guidance on `text conventions for user interfaces <http://helix.rax.io/style/text-conventions.html>`__, and a
`UI toolkit for developers <https://rackerlabs.github.io/helix-ui/>`__.

You can access `all Helix code and documentation <http://helix.rax.io/>`__ at
the top level for the Helix project.
