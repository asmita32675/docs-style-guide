Blog guidelines
===============

Developers often ask an Information Developer to edit a blog post that they
wrote and pushed to the
https://github.com/rackerlabs/docs-developer-blog repository. Posts in this
repository are published to the Rackspace Expert Insights Blog site at
https://developer.rackspace.com/blog/.

When you write a post, use the writing guidelines in this Style Guide as you
would with other documentation that is curated by the Information Development
team. Start with the information in the :ref:`quickstart`.

This topic provides additional guidelines specific to writing postss for the
Rackspace Expert Insights Blog site.

Things to consider before writing a blog post
---------------------------------------------

Before you start writing, consider the following questions:

- What is the goal of this Expert Insights post? Describe it in two sentences or
  less.

  - Is it to be helpful and answer a question or offer how-to information?
  - Is it to provide “thought leadership” or show our expertise in an area?
    If so, describe what you’d like to convey. If it's less technical,
    consider sunbmitting it to the Solve blog, published at
    https://www.rackspace.com/solve.
  - Is it something else altogether? If so, what? It’s possible that your
    idea might be better presented as an article on the How-To support site
    at https://support.rackspace.com/ or as a post with a marketing flavor
    published at https://blog.rackspace.com/.

- What is the significance of the content of the post? Is it how to use a new
  offering? How is it helpful to customers? Does it frame our
  expertise is a new way?
- Explain how the content of the post aligns with, supports, or strengthens
  Rackspace’s current business priorities and strategy.
- Who is the target audience for this post?
- What specific customer problems or pain points does the post address?
  Provide names of customers willing to be references in support of the post.
- Does the post describe how to use something that Rackspace provides that
  it does better than the competition or that no other competitor offers? Does
  the post provide quantifiable and defensible information (such as
  performance metrics) showing the Rackspace edge over the competition? If
  yes, explain.

Blog post writing suggestions
-----------------------------

When you write your content, we recommend the following rules of thumb:

-  **Length**: Rackspace blog posts generally run between 500-1,000 words, but
   let the content be your guide. Take the space you need to tell your story, but
   don’t pad it unnecessarily. Going long is okay, too, as long as it’s worth
   reading. We can also convert a single post to a series, if necessary.

-  **Tools**: Use the word processor or text editor of your choice to write the
   blog.

-  **General format**:

   - An attention-grabbing opening, known in the news business as a *lede*

   - A *nut graf*: a sentence or two letting readers know what you’re going
     to be talking about and why it matters

   - Some background information or context, such as the history of a product

   - A conclusion (and a call to action, if appropriate) with links and contact
     information

- **Consistency**: Be as consistent as possible in style with other posts on the
  Rackspace Expert Insights Blog site.

- **Bullet points**: Bullet points are useful for listing features.

- **Images**:

  - Images should directly support or illustrate post content. Examples
    include a screen shot, diagram, or table that illustrates the concept or
    technique that is being described.
  - Any image pulled from another source should provide a reference to the
    source directly underneath the image.
  - Add social media icons with their links for twitter, Facebook, and
    LinkedIn at the bottom of the blog post. (Information Development provides
    a template for this that you can add to your post.)

- **Reference section**: If your content uses a lot of content from another
  source, provide a Reference section at the bottom of the blog post with a
  link to the reference.

- **Be helpful**: Think *be helpful* rather than trying to sell a product or
  service. *What* does the product do? *How* does it help the customer?

- **Write a good lede**: When crafting your lede, consider how the information
  in your post helps customers. An announcement of a new product is not a
  lede, but that product’s money-saving capacity might well be one. For
  example:

  **Not good**: Today, Rackspace is pleased to announce the release of four new
  features in Office 365.

  **Good**: Increased storage, security, and cost-saving measures are now
  available to enhance the already-robust Office 365 suite available from
  Rackspace, making it even more attractive to a wider variety of business
  users.

- **Stay focused on your topic**: If you find yourself straying, you might have
  enough material for a series. It’s okay to break up a big topic into more
  digestible bites. Formulas like How to, Top 5 or 10, and curated lists
  tend to do well.

- **Show don’t tell**: Can you create a graphic or image, or add a screen shot
  to illustrate your point?

- **Avoid jargon**: Rackers (and the entire tech industry) tend to speak in
  jargon. Unless your post is aimed at a specialized, technical audience, use
  plain English. There is never a reason to use business jargon.

- **Link link link**: A first product mention? Link to the product page. Outside
  accolades? Link to it. Citing a study or source or article? Link to it.
  Have we written about it before? Link to it. Mention a partner or
  customer? Link to their site.

- **Keep it concise**: The Internet has shrunken everyone’s attention span.
  Say it once, say it well. No need to repeat the same information in
  different format. Similarly, keep paragraphs short. Long blocks of text
  are intimidating. Use concrete examples whenever possible. If you get
  stuck, don’t fret. Just send your draft to the blog team. We’re here to
  help.

Voice and tone
--------------

Use these guidelines to write a post that is friendly, helpful, and inspires
confidence.

The primary job of the words in a post is to help users complete tasks with no
confusion and minimal interruption. However, the voice and tone that we use
with words also influence how people think and feel about Rackspace.

Voice is our style, and communicates our personality to the user. Tone is our
mood, and communicates our attitude about the subject to the user.

The words we choose, and the ways we use them, should reflect our goals:
building trust, inspiring confidence, making things easier, and developing a
relationship with Rackspace users.

When you write blog post text, use words that reflect the following attributes:

- Human
- Trustworthy
- Knowledgeable
- Accurate
- Professional
- Approachable
- Helpful

Consider the following best practices for voice and tone when you write blog
post text:

- Write in a way that the user wants to be spoken to. Use helpful words and
  phrases that are informative, simple, clear, and easy to understand.

- Temper the enthusiasm conveyed in confirmation messages.

- Be careful about laying blame. Don’t take the blame for a negative
  situation. Don’t lay the blame of the negative situation on the user.

- In positive situations, be encouraging and offer next steps. Don’t take
  credit for the user’s success.

- In negative situations, be clear about the problem and how the user can fix
  it. Don’t ask the user to trust us without providing more information.

Write to the user by using second person and imperative mood
------------------------------------------------------------

Users are more engaged with content when it talks to them directly. You
talk to users directly by using *second person*, addressing the user as
*you*. Second person also promotes a friendly tone. For more information, see
:ref:`write-to-the-user`.

The following guidelines for writing to the user apply specifically to the
Rackspace Expert Insight blog posts:

-  For posts, use the first-person singular pronoun *I* only when authors of
   posts are describing their own actions or opinions.

-  Switching person (point of view) is acceptable in blog posts that use
   first-person singular but then switch to second person for instructional
   steps.

Plagiarism: Understand and avoid it
-----------------------------------

Plagiarism is stealing someone else’s words and presenting them as your own
without giving credit to the author. Suppose your boss asked you to paint a
picture of a cat, and you gave him a cat picture created by someone else. That’s
wrong, right? Maybe if the boss just needed any cat painting, it would be ok, as
long as you told him that Bob Smith painted it (and hopefully you bought it or
have Bob’s permission to use it). However, if your boss needed to see your
painting, perhaps to evaluate your skill, then passing Bob’s work off as your
own is theft and deceit, plain and simple.

**One way to think of it**: Never copy and paste (or type in) someone else’s
brilliant text without saying where the words came from.

**Another consideration**:  In your blog post, you communicate something you
know about and care about. The topic is important to you. Knowing the
information in your post helps you do your job, helps others, explains complex
topics, and so on. So, share that information in your own words from your own
experience.

So, how do you avoid plagiarism? Give credit to your source in one of the
following ways:

1) **Directly quote your unnamed source**. For example: According to the Oracle BI
   Enterprise Edition (https://www.oracle.com/business-analytics/business-intelligence/technologies/bi-enterprise-edition.html):
   “Oracle Business Intelligence 12c is a unique platform that enables customers
   to uncover new insights and make faster, more informed business decisions by
   offering agile visual analytics and self-service discovery together with
   best-in-class enterprise analytics.”
2) **Directly quote a named source**. For example: Rittman Mead explains the
   problem in his post (https://www.rittmanmead.com/blog/2018/11/where-are-my-users-coming-from-analysing-obiee-connections-methods/):
   “But one day you start noticing new BI tools appearing in your company that
   provide similar KPIs to the ones you are already exposing and you start
   questioning where those data are coming from.”
3) Paraphrase the source (named or unnamed). For example: Rittman Read (https://www.rittmanmead.com/blog/2018/11/where-are-my-users-coming-from-analysing-obiee-connections-methods/)
   talks about how new BI tools with KPIs like yours just show up, and you can’t
   identify the data source.

Here's another example of avoiding plagiarism. This source
(https://www.easybib.com/guides/plagiarism-guide/how-to-avoid-accidental-plagiarism/)
yielded the following nugget: “Remember, your paper is an example of your writing,
so you should be expressing your original thoughts, not just repeating published
ideas. Outside sources are there for you to learn more about your topic and to
provide evidence to your claim only. By writing a completely original first draft,
you will ensure that your paper is a reflection of your own hard work.”  (See? 
credited and linked source and quoted text!)

In other words, if your post is nothing but a collection of quotes and paraphrases
from other sources with nothing of your own expertise and experience, another
topic might suit you better.

But what if, although you know your topic in-depth, you just aren’t that good
with words? Or English is your second or even third language? In that case, you
might think pulling all those quotes (*and* giving proper credit) would be
appropriate. Well, kind of, but here’s an even better option. A blog post is
generally a more casual or conversation piece, not intended to be an example of
perfect scholarly erudition for the ages. So, while expert content is critcal,
perfect English isn’t necessarily required in the submission draft. Also, your
blog editor is here to help! Editors love tweaking and polishing words so the
readers can get exactly what they need from the post without the distraction of
imperfect grammar or usage. So, send in your words and thoughts, and let the
editors work their magic.
