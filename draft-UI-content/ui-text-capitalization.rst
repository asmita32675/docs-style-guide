UI text capitalization guidelines
=================================

Interface element labels use a combination of headline-style capitalization
and sentence-style capitalization. It is important to apply these
capitalization guidelines consistently to make the UI clear and succinct.

Headline-style capitalization capitalizes every word in the text, except the
following word types :

- Articles, except as the first word (a, an, the)
- Coordinating conjunctions (and, or)
- Prepositions, except the first or last word
- Infinitives (to, in, an)

The following table shows examples for headline-style capitalization:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 50 50
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Use
     - Don't use
   * - Restore Defaults
     - Restore defaults
   * - Allocate to Project
     - Allocate to project

The following table shows examples for sentence-style capitalization, which
only capitalizes the first word in the text, unless the word is a proper noun
that must be capitalized:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 50 50
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Use
     - Don't use
   * - Maximum number of downloads
     - Maximum Number of Downloads
   * - Allocate to Project
     - Allocate to project
