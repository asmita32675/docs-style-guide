User interface content guidelines
=================================

Use these User interface (UI) text guidelines if you are a designer,
developer, or reviewer contributing content in Rackspace UIs.
Use these text guidelines to ensure that the Rackspace UI is usable,
consistent, and concise.

In addition to this information, ensure that you review the following
sections, which also apply to content in the UI:

-  :ref:`general writing guidelines<index-writing-guidelines>`
-  :ref:`style guidelines<index-style-guidelines>`

**Top tips**

Use these tips and quick links to access UI text guidance reminders.

-  Avoid :ref:`abbreviations<abbreviations>`, acronyms, and slang. Use an
   abbreviation only if it is better known than the word that it stands for or
   if space savings is critical.
-  Write in :ref:`active voice<use-active-voice>`.
-  Be :ref:`clear and concise<write-clear-concise-sentences-paragraphs>`.
-  Write objectively. Do not use humor, jargon, exclamation marks, idioms,
   metaphors, and other colloquialisms.
-  Use :ref:`contractions<contractions>` according to the Rackspace style for
   technical content.
