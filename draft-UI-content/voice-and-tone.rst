Voice and tone
==============

Voice is our style, our point of view, and our personality. Tone is our
attitude and how we are perceived by those who read (and hear) our words. Voice
determines how we write. Tone determines our attitude to subject and audience
and how we're perceived by our audience.

**Dial up, dial down**: Context is everything. We turn up the voice volume in
campaign banner ad taglines, but we dial it down in a press release or an
annual report. All of it - no matter where it lands - should sound like us.


**Do this, not that**: Good writing should always be muscular. It should move
the reader - not just from one line to the next, but give them a reason to
react. Sometimes, in a technical description of identity management for Azure,
it doesn't make sense to inject a lot of brand personality. The goal, in
that context, is to get out of the way. But in banner ads, emails, white paper
introductions and conclusions, even in data sheets and sales battle cards,
there are specific places where we can sneak in our personality. Here are some
general suggestions:


- **Avoid flat, informational writing in lead-ins and intros.** Make it
  specific, explicit, emotional and targeted. For example, let's kill off the
  obligatory/third-person "Businesses today experience X" as our go-to first
  line a white paper or data sheet intro. For a white paper on Managed
  Security, maybe we lead in with an arresting statistic, targeted at our
  prospect: "Chances are good that you're already acutely aware of the risk of
  a data breach inside your business. According to last year's *National
  Security Survey*, 71% of all US organizations experienced a cyberattack in
  2015."


- **Be Insightful. Avoid truisms.** Being bold and confident means we aren't
  afraid to demonstrate insight. If we begin a white paper intro with
  something dull like "Businesses today's face a multitude of challenges" we
  have already sent an implicit message: expect information, but not thought
  leadership from us.


- **Diction matters. So does being concise.** When faced with two possible
  ways of phrasing something, choose the shorter, less formal way unless
  there's a contextual reason to do otherwise. For example, choose *maybe*
  over *perhaps*, and *because* over *the reason is*.


- **Being bold is not the same as bragging.** As in some of our banner
  headlines, we're okay with sometimes blowing our own horn. But what prevents
  it from being an empty brag is that we connect it to why it matters -
  solving a problem for our customers. Following are some banner examples:

  - 1 billion hours managing OpenStack clouds? Talk about putting time on your
    side.
  - Certified to manage the world's leading clouds. Because one size doesn't
    fit all.
  - The cloud alone isn't "smart." Hiring a global network of cloud experts is.

Title: Building Your Ecommerce Strategy

INTRODUCTION
Ecommerce refers to the sum of all interactions a customer has with your
business across website, mobile, and other digital experiences. The more a
customer shops on your website, the more likely they are to refer their friends
and family. The brand experience you create online is integral to bringing
shoppers back and spreading your reputation by word-of-mouth to attract new
customers.

Starting with a basic ecommerce strategy helps you identify and plan for gaps,
account for compliance, and support customer satisfaction by considering all of
the moving parts of your store.

Without a strategy, you could face:
o Confusing layouts that result in increased bounce rates
o Security issues causing lost trust and bad press
o Lack of compliance, resulting in big fines or an inability to take payments
o Bad resource planning which might lead to outages that disable sales

The desired customer outcome should drive the business focus, the technologies

used, and the security measures implemented to build trust, loyalty, repeat
business, and referrals.

In addition, overall site performance is extremely important. A one-second
delay
in response can lead to a 7% drop in conversions.*	Title: Building Your
Ecommerce Strategy

INTRODUCTION
Your ecommerce platform fundamentally shapes the way consumers experience your
brand. If the experience is positive -not to mention seamless and fast on any
device - then your business benefits from a growing word-of-mouth reputation.
Especially in the age of social media.

But if your ecommerce platform is sluggish, it's likely to impact your bottom
line quickly. A recent study from Gartner suggests that a one-second delay in
an ecommerce website can lead to a 7% drop in sales conversions.

Building a basic ecommerce strategy allows you to identify and plan for gaps,
account for compliance, and support customer satisfaction by considering all of
the moving parts of your store.

Without a strategy, you could face:
o Confusing layouts that result in increased bounce rates
o Security issues causing lost trust and bad press
o Lack of compliance, resulting in big fines or an inability to take payments
o Bad resource planning, which might lead to outages that disable sales

With the right ecommerce strategy in place, you'll lay the foundation for an
optimized digital experience that builds trust, loyalty and referrals.



The prose is sharper and more direct. The logical flow is better and it's
more concise and impactful. We don't waste time telling them what ecommerce
refers to or how repeat business works. We take it as a given they know that
and move to insight. We bring in the stat where it matters, instead of
letting it languish at the bottom of the intro.

Subhead:
The cloud of your choice, without the expense and complexity of managing it
all yourself.	Subhead:
Your clouds. Our expertise.	Simpler, more memorable, aligned to our new brand
strategy.
Intro:
Businesses today must tap the power of the cloud to stay competitive. They
need to use cloud technologies to better serve their customers online and on
mobile devices. They need to crunch data for insights into their operations
and customer behavior.

But many companies are overwhelmed by the complexity and cost of trying to
manage a cloud - or multiple clouds - by themselves. Cloud expertise is scarce
and expensive.

The technologies are constantly changing. At the same time, companies struggle
to meet compliance requirements and secure their apps and data.

To keep up, they can chase hard-to-find IT talent while juggling multiple
providers.

Or they can find a single, expert technology partner to help them manage the
world's leading clouds - whichever ones best suit their unique needs.

Rackspace combines specialized expertise, easy-to-use tools and
results-obsessed customer service - across Amazon Web Services (AWS),
Microsoft®, OpenStack® and VMware®. We'll help you choose from a broad
portfolio of public, private and hybrid clouds, as well as dedicated servers,
to design a best-fit solution for your business.	Intro:
The cloud was supposed to make our lives easier. But it turns out, the cloud
is complicated to build, run, maintain and manage - especially across multiple
platforms and locations, with technology that's always changing.

If it feels like the cloud has been managing you, it's time to turn the tables.

With Rackspace by your side, you can thrive in today's multi-cloud world. We
will help you tap the power of cloud computing - across OpenStack, Amazon Web
Services, Microsoft and VMware technologies - without the pain, complexity and
cost of doing it all yourself.	It's immediate and acknowledges a customer
